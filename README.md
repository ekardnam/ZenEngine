# ZenEngine
ZenEngine aims to be a simple engine. It was born out of me wanting an engine where I can use native code as well as scripting, plus me wanting to learn game engine development.
At the same time it aims to be simpler then for example Unreal Engine (where you can actually mix native code and scripts).

# Acknoledgements
Parts of the code are taken from the Hazel 2D project (even though this is a 3D engine) which you can find at: https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel/ and is licensed under the APACHE 
license. Definitely check out the Hazel project https://hazelengine.com/ and Yan "TheCherno" Chernikov YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject.
